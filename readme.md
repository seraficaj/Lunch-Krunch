# LunchKrunch, a budgeting app for people who need to cook more often.

## What does this app do?
I was inspired to do this project after realizing how much I like takeout. I could probably save a lot more money by cooking or brining leftovers for lunch to work instead. 

## What technologies were used to make this app?
- Back-end: Node.js and Express.js 
- Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose ORM)
- Front-End: EJS templating from express.js and W3.css (a CSS library)
